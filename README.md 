# Landing Page

## Introduce

This Landing Page consists of three main sections: Header, Content, and Footer.

The Header will include a navbar with buttons corresponding to each section.

The Content section contains four sections in the following order: Section 1, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4.

## Usage

For tablet and computer screens, the header already displays the section buttons. You just need to click on any section button, and the page will automatically scroll to the corresponding section.

For mobile screens, the section buttons are not displayed by default. You have to click on the navbar button to reveal the section buttons, and the remaining interactions are the same as for tablets and computers. To close the navigation, you click the close button on the navbar.
